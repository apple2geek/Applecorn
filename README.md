# Applecorn

Applecorn is a ProDOS application for the Apple //e Enhanced which provides
an environment for Acorn BBC Microcomputer language ROMs to run.  This
allows BBC BASIC and other Acorn languages to run on the Apple //e.

## Hardware Requirements

Enhanced (65C02) Apple //e with 128KB of memory.

## How to Run the Software

Boot the diskette `applecorn.po` which is a 143KB Disk ][ bootable ProDOS
diskette.  I use version 2.4.2 of ProDOS for my testing, but the software
should run on other versions of ProDOS.

Run `BASIC.SYSTEM` and at the Applesoft BASIC prompt type:
```
BRUN APPLECORN
```
to start the software.

Applecorn will then load the content of the file `BASIC.ROM` from the
diskette.  This is a 16KB file containing BBC BASIC v2 from the BBC Micro.
Once the ROM has loaded, it will automatically be started and you will
see the `>` prompt of BBC BASIC.

32 Kilobytes of space is available for your programs and variables. `PAGE`
is set to `&0E0`.

## Theory of Operation

### BBC Micro 

On the BBC Micro, language ROMs have a very clean interface to the Machine
Operating System (MOS).  Syscalls are used for all accesses to the hardware,
rather than poking at memory mapped addresses directly, as is common in
other 6502 systems.  This was done partly to enable programs to run on a 
second processor connected to the main BBC Micro over an interprocessor
interface called The Tube.

On the BBC Micro, the 64K address space looks like this:

```
                 +----------------------+ $ffff
                 |                      |
                 | MOS ROM (16KB)       |
                 |                      |
                 +----------------------+ $c000
                 |                      |
                 | Language ROM (16KB)  |
                 |                      |
                 +----------------------+ $8000
                 |                      |
                 | User RAM (32K)       |
                 |                      |
                 |                      |
                 |                      |
                 |                      |
                 |//////////////////////|
                 +----------------------+ $0000
```
The hatched area at the bottom represents reserved space such as zero page,
the stack and pages 2 through 7 which are used by the language ROM for
various purposes.

Display memory on the BBC Micro is allocated at the top of user RAM, from
$8000 down.  Higher resolution modes use more memory, reducing the user RAM
available for BASIC programs.

The BBC Micro uses a unique paging mechanism referred to as 'Sideways ROM',
which allows up to 16 language and filing system ROMs to be banked into the
16KB space from $8000 to $bfff.

### Apple //e

The Apple //e, with 128KB has two 64KB banks of memory.  The main memory bank
is as follows:
```
   +----------------------+ $ffff +----------------------+
   | BASIC/Monitor ROM    |       | Language Card        |
   |                      |       |                      | +-4K Bank Two----+
   |###I/O Space (4KB)####|       +----------------------+ +----------------+
   +----------------------+ $c000
   |                      |
   |                      |
   |                      |
   |                      |
   |                      |
   | User RAM (48K)       |
   |                      |
   |                      |
   |                      |
   |                      |
   |//////////////////////|
   +----------------------+ $0000
```
Here there is 48KB of RAM rather than 32KB, and the total ROM is just 12KB,
starting at $d000.  The 4KB from $c000 to $cfff is all memory mapped I/O.

An additional 16KB of memory is available, which is referred to as the
Language Card.  This memory can be banked into the space where the ROM usually
resides from $d000 up.  Note that this space is only 12KB so the 16KB LC
memory is itself banked with the bottom 4KB of LC space having two banks.

When an Extended 80 Column card is installed in the aux slot of the Apple
//e, an additional 64KB of RAM is added, for a total of 128KB.  The entire
arrangement described above is duplicated, so there is 64KB of main memory
(divided between the 'lower 48K' and 16KB of LC memory) and 64KB of
auxiliary memory (divided in exactly the same manner.)

The Apple //e has softswitches to select whether to address the main or aux
bank for the main portion of RAM (ie: the 48KB up to $bfff).  Reading and
writing may be switched separately so it is possible to execute code and
read data from one bank while writing to the other.  A separate softswitch
controls whether zero page, the stack, and LC memory addresses will be passed
to main or aux banks.

The ProDOS operating system resides primarily in the main bank Language
Card memory, so this memory is not available to Applecorn if we wish to
retain the facilties provided by ProDOS.

The Apple //e screen normally resides from $400 to $7ff in main memory (for
40 column mode) or at $400 to $7ff in both main and aux memory (for 80
column mode.)  There is a softswitch to switch to text page two from $800
to $bff.

### Applecorn Architecture

- Applecorn maintains a 'BBC Micro virtual machine' in the Apple //e auxiliary
  memory. In particular, the 'BBC Micro' has its own zero page and stack in
  auxiliary memory, so there is no contention with ProDOS or with Applecorn.
- Applecorn primarily uses the main memory for servicing ProDOS file system
  requests for the 'BBC Micro virtual machine'.
- An 80 column screen is configured using PAGE2 memory from $800 to $bfff
  in both main and aux memory.  This conveniently just fits in above page 7,
  which is the highest page used as Acorn language ROM workspace.
- The Acorn language ROM is loaded to $8000 in aux memory.
- The Language Card memory is enabled and used to store the 'Applecorn MOS'
  from $d000 up in aux memory.  (The main bank LC memory contains ProDOS.)
- Applecorn copies its own 'Applecorn MOS' code to $d000 in aux memory and
  relocates the MOS entry vectors to high memory.
- The only real difference between the Apple //e aux memory map and that of
  the BBC Micro is the Apple //e has a 'hole' from $c000 to $cfff where memory
  mapped I/O resides.  Fortunately this does not really matter because the 
  language only uses well-defined entry points to call into the MOS, so we
  can simply avoid this address range.

### Star Commands

`*QUIT` - Terminate Applecorn and quit to ProDOS.  Because the 'BBC Micro'
lives in auxiliary memory, you can usually restart Applecorn by running it
again and recover your program with `OLD`.

`*HELP` - Prints out information similar to the same command on the BBC micro.
Specifically it lists the version of Applecorn MOS and the name of the current
language ROM.

`*CAT` (or `*.`) - Simple listing of the files in the current directory.

`*DIR pathname` - Allows the current directory to be changed to any ProDOS
path.  For example `*DIR /H1/APPLECORN`.
